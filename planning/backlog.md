A collection of user stories.

## Must-Haves

These are necessary for basic usability

1. As a user, I want the title of the website to be clear and descriptive, so
   that I can quickly understand what the website is about and what type of
   information I can expect to find there.
2. As a user, I want the site to be easy to navigate and clear to quickly find
   the information I am interested in.
3. As a user, I want to be able to access a site that contains information about
   different trees so that I can learn about their characteristics and uses.
4. Design a visually appealing and user-friendly website interface.

## Should-Haves

These will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

1. Contact information: A section that includes your contact details, such as
   your email address, phone number, and physical address.
2. Newsletter: A section that allows users to sign up for your email newsletter,
   which can help you stay in touch with your audience and promote your content
   and events.
3. Related links: Links to other websites, resources, or organizations that are
   related to your website's topic and may be of interest to your users.

1. Educational resources: Tools and resources for teachers, students, and
   lifelong learners, such as books PDF.
