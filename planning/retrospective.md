## Start Doing

- Working with local organizations to promote tree planting and conservation in
  our community Incorporating more interactive elements on our website, such as
  quizzes and surveys Conducting surveys to better understand the needs and
  interests of our audience

## Lessons Learned

- Consistency is key to creating and publishing content User feedback should be
  taken seriously and used to improve our website and services

## Strategy vs. Board

  benefits, but we found that our audience was also interested in learning about
  local conservation efforts and ways to get involved in tree planting
  initiatives.

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Our strategy of providing educational content about trees has been successful
  and well received by our audience. Our presence on social media has helped us
  reach a wider audience and connect with people who are passionate about trees.

- No, everything was as planned.
